## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-vite`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can start developing your React application using Vite. Edit the source files in the `src` directory, and Vite will automatically update the browser with the latest changes thanks to its fast HMR feature.

## What I Learned

While developing this Movie Search App, I learned several valuable lessons:

- **Working with React:** I gained experience in building a React application from scratch, including creating components, managing state, and handling user interactions.

- **Consuming APIs:** I learned how to fetch data from external APIs using the `fetch` API in JavaScript and process the returned JSON data to display relevant information to users.

- **Handling State:** I became proficient in managing state in React components, including using the `useState` hook to update component state based on user actions or API responses.

- **Conditional Rendering:** I learned how to conditionally render components and content based on different states, such as displaying a loading spinner while data is being fetched or showing search results based on user input.

- **Error Handling:** I gained insight into error handling techniques, such as displaying error messages to users when API requests fail or search queries return no results.

- **UI/UX Design:** I explored various design patterns and techniques to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, including implementing responsive design principles to ensure a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Git and Version Control:** I practiced using Git for version control, committing changes, and collaborating with others on the project by pushing and pulling changes to and from remote repositories.

- **Project Documentation:** I improved my skills in documenting project features, dependencies, and usage instructions to facilitate collaboration and onboarding for other developers.

Overall, this project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in front-end development, React programming, API integration, and project management, contributing to my growth as a developer.
